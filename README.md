## ENEE459b Final Project - Binary Disassembly 
This was a project done in my reverse engineering lab class during my fall 2018 semester at UMD. 

For context, our previous project was to create an ELF file analyzer which had to accept an ELF binary file and report on information such as the size of specific sections, hashes of the data, and other information which required using libraries to dissect the binary. Additionally, we had to program an authentication method to use the program and a way to store an encrypted record of that information. 

In this project, we were given another student's symbol table stripped binary file and tasked to find information on how their authentication method worked, what sort of data structures were used to store the information, and what vulnerabilities were exploitable. This was done in IDA Freeware and the write up of the disassembly is available to read in "Project 2 writeup.docx"
